# Deployment: Stacks deployer address (testnet/mainnet).
# Copy this file to .env in the repo root (not in contracts/). Never commit .env.
# Example: testnet ST33HZRHVDY39CH8K1C5WD91HDHT8VV368RY9E9TD, mainnet SP33HZRHVDY39CH8K1C5WD91HDHT8VV368S1ZYFFG.
# If set, the script tries 4000 derivation paths from DEPLOYER_SECRET_KEY to find this address; if none match, it falls back to the derived address (or you must set DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY).
DEPLOYER_ADDRESS=

# For npm run deploy:testnet. See https://docs.stacks.co/stacks.js/contract-deployment and https://docs.stacks.co/stacks.js/private-keys.
# Use one of:
#   DEPLOYER_SECRET_KEY = your 24 words (Leather: Settings → Secret Key). Script derives key at BIP44 path m/44'/5757'/0'/0/n.
#   DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY = 64-char hex (or 66-char with trailing 01). Use this to deploy from ST33.../SP33... if the mnemonic does not derive to that address.
DEPLOYER_SECRET_KEY=

# Derivation path indices (default 0). Try 1 if your wallet address is ST33... but script shows ST2...
# DEPLOYER_ACCOUNT_INDEX=0
# DEPLOYER_ADDRESS_INDEX=0

# Optional: BIP39 passphrase if your wallet uses one (some wallets add extra security with a passphrase).
# BIP39_PASSPHRASE=

# Optional: Manual derivation path override. If you know the exact path (e.g., from find-leather-address.mjs),
# set this to skip the automatic search. Example: MANUAL_DERIVATION_PATH=m/44'/5757'/0'/0/123
# MANUAL_DERIVATION_PATH=

# Testnet RPC URL. Must be testnet (not mainnet) so your testnet wallet balance is used.
